A brief description of what this project does and who it's for...


## What actually is this?
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game!


## How it Works?

## First of all to run this project, try running index.html in updated and latest browsers with connected internet connection!

If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

1. A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
2. The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
3. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
4.If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
